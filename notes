2017 grids needed

    mehdipour SED, solar, 10²² - 10²⁴
    magdziarz SED, solar, 10²² - 10²⁴
    magdziarz SED, metals 0.5 & element scale factor carbon 2, 10²² - 10²⁴




By end of March: two grids run, continuum points decided upon, models decided upon

Run grid with new SED, or at least a point, check values: how to find the appropriate values to change our list accordingly, and what might need to be change?

        



    ✓   faint to equivalent width of 0.001 angstrom

    ✓   compare between c13 and c17 -- show diferences in emergent line lists

    ✓   new print lines to help reduce number of printed lines -- and to show old lines?

    ✓   run models for comparising: 10.5,19.5

    □   Why so many Fe 2 lines?

    □   check if blnds are sums of the expected multiplets

    ✓   add in more levels to the H atom, unresolved, 20, also add some to paschen, maybe others -- check how much time is lost

    ✓   punch the paschen and balmer lines up to 18

    □   Read Intrinsic Lines

    □   Smoothing algorithm using n-dimensional smoothing

    □   Contour plots

    ✓   Run Grids in c17

    □   Email about order of lines

    □   Find blend correlated names and update



    check on ratios of inwd lines for blends 

    check hazy for RRC H  1 meaning

    c  3  1175->538, seen twice?

    2 TOTL lines -> He 1   

    for c13 if thor open:

        magziarz, 10^23, use 2000 korista and goad abundances apj, also default abundance 



use notes from paper to design contour plots

what is the right way to model the components? check mehdipour and magdziarz paper, and comptonization paper

more?



how many collapsed levels do we have?

15 for H⁰ and He⁺, 2 for everything else


other codes:

mappings, ion, X-STAR



print iso collapsed  ✓


include lines:

8205A

BAC 3646

BAC 0

Pac 0


hapsed lines




print line cutoff reduced to  -- nevermind
